                        I’m a creative and curious frontend developer and graphic designer who thrives on turning ideas into engaging digital experiences. While my behavioral profile highlights strengths in adaptability and creativity over being strictly organized or overly focused, I see this as a driver of innovation: I’m not afraid to think outside the box, explore new approaches, and embrace challenges from fresh perspectives.
                        With a background in Multimedia Design and freelance experience in branding, rebranding, and web design, I combine a strong technical foundation with a natural flair for aesthetics. This allows me to craft solutions that are both functional and visually appealing.
                        I believe my balance of creativity, flexibility, and technical skill makes me well-suited for dynamic environments where ideas evolve quickly, and where curiosity and adaptability are just as important as structure.
